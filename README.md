# Bernies-Wage-Convo

This repository is a response to Bernie Sanders' tweet asserting that real wages have declined for the poorest Americans since 1963.

The analysis here challenges that claim by showing how real wage growth looks very different depending on the inflation index used for adjustment. Unfortunately, both Bernie—and, more importantly, our government—rely on a flawed inflation measure that paints a much bleaker picture than reality suggests.

In this repo, you’ll find all the code used to compare wage growth for lower-income Americans, adjusted using two different inflation indices. The results reveal that real wage growth is stronger than reported when using a more accurate inflation measure.

## What's Inside
Analysis comparing real wage growth using both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Chained CPI.

A demonstration of how traditional inflation measures overstate inflation and understate true wage growth.
